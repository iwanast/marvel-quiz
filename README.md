<h3>Marvel Quiz: The Ultimate Marvel Fan Quiz - Hyper Island Project 3</h2>

Brief: Group project to create a quiz game that incorporates Firebase.

Timeframe: three weeks.

Description: The Ultimate Marvel Fan Quiz is an online game that tests the user's knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe by presenting them with a series of questions, chosen randomly from a large pool, and asks them to select an answer from the four provided. The quiz can be taken on easy or hard difficulty, to cater to both casual and hardcore fans. 

Questions and answers are stored in a Firestore database. The easy and hard questions and answers are retrieved and ten are selected randomly from the chosen difficulty when the game is started. The four answers are also randomized when displayed on the quiz page. Once the player has answered twn questions, their score will be stored in the database and a score page will be generated displaying the user's score, the average score for that difficulty, and a different gif/quote for each different score bracket.
